# Configure Knowledge Layers

BC Code Intelligence uses a layered knowledge system that allows you to customize the AI assistant with your organization's standards and best practices.

## Layer Hierarchy

1. **Embedded** - Built-in BC/AL knowledge (always enabled)
2. **Company** - Organization-wide standards from a Git repository
3. **Team** - Team-specific overrides
4. **Project** - Local project overrides in `./bc-code-intel-overrides/`
